# Sentence Embedding Model with Data Augmentation 
Contrastive learning for fine-tuning sentene embedding model to learn semantic similarity between sentences using open source STS (Semantic Textual Similarity) datasets.
Data Augmentation method based on DP (Dependency Parsing) is implemented for auto-generation of silver datasets to improve vector representations for structrally incomplete sentences that are frequently used in real life.
